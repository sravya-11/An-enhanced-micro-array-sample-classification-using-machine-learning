1) Required Software:
   - Python IDE: You can choose to run your code in colab or any other Python IDE of your choice, such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.

2) Requirements:
   - Hardware: A computer with sufficient RAM and processing power to handle image processing tasks.
   - Operating System: The code should run on any operating system that supports Python, such as Windows, macOS, or Linux.
   - Storage: You need enough storage space to store the dataset and any intermediate files generated during the execution of the code.

3) Predefined Modules:
      The code relies on several Python libraries and modules, including:
      - NumPy: For numerical computations.
      - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
      - Matplotlib: For data visualization.
      - scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks such as metrics and model evaluation.
      - Other modules such as tqdm, seaborn, umap, PIL, and more, depending on the specific functionalities of your code.

4) Execution Procedure:
   - Step 1: Install Python and the required Python libraries/modules listed above.
   - Step 2: Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
   - Step 3: Open the colab or your chosen Python IDE.
   - Step 4: Load the dataset and preprocess it as necessary.
   - Step 5: Run the code cells sequentially to train the model, evaluate its performance, and generate any required plots or outputs.
   - Step 6: Monitor the execution for any errors or warnings and troubleshoot as needed.
   - Step 7: Once the execution is complete, review the results and analyze the output generated by the code.
   - Step 8: Save or export the results as needed for further analysis or reporting.
